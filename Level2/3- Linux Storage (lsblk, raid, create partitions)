BACKUPS
RAID 1 – Mirroring
- Any written data to Disk 1 is mirrored over to Disk 2
- If loosing Disk 1, everything is in Disk 2

RAID 0 – Striping
- Break the data and spread in over Disk 1 and 2
- If loosing Disk 1 or 2, will loose the data

	CREATE PARTITIONS AND VOLUMES
Hard drives were usually diced up into partitions: Take one hard drive and divide it into multiple virtual hard drives
	Types of partition managements:
- Master Boot Record (MBR): Record where those partitions are : 
  --  Up to 4 partitions (including SWAP, Boot file, and Rest of the hard drives)
  -- No large hard drive supported
  -- Used by old linux on embaded systems (Web cameras, routers, ...)
- Guid (Globally unique Identifier) Partition Table (GPT):  
  -- Identify partitions
  -- Up to 128 partitions
  -- Most recent linux use GPT

Command:
- MBR: 
# fdisk -l /dev/sdb		# list the partition on sdb
Last sector: how big do you want the partition to be?
w: to save it
